Order and how to run the code:

Step 1: export records from koha in marcxml format and save to input folder
        be careful to export only Books
        when exporting other record types, ensure to hard code the type in reformat.py

Step 2: run makefile.py to break big marcxml into individual records
        individual records are saved to non_dupes_records folder

Step 3: run findupe.py to separate duplicates from non-duplicates
        duplicates are saved to dupes_records folder while non-duplicates remain in non_dupes_records
        read through dupe_info_file.txt for double checking

Step 4: run reformat.py to reformat non-duplicates records
        reformatted records are saved to reformat_records and are ready to be sent for ingestion by OMNI

Step 5: save all folders to local disk before clearing workspace and working with another batch
